Sportify üèÜ
Sportify is a comprehensive backend solution for managing sports teams, players, and competitions. Built with Spring Boot, it offers a scalable and efficient way to handle sports-related data, including JWT-based security, AOP logging, and custom exception handling. It also features Swagger API documentation and is deployable on AWS.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sportify.git
cd sportify
Build the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, use Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Access Swagger documentation at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
üåê API Endpoints & Documentation:
GET /players - Retrieve all players
POST /players - Add a new player
GET /competitions - Retrieve all competitions
POST /competitions - Add a new competition
Swagger UI provides interactive API documentation. Visit:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
üîí Security:
Sportify uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for securing APIs. The following endpoints are protected and require a valid JWT token:

/players (POST)
/competitions (POST)
JWT-based security ensures stateless authentication and secure token management.

Example of acquiring a JWT token:
bash
Copy code
POST /auth/login
You will receive a JWT token upon successful login, which must be included in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests:

makefile
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <token>
‚ö†Ô∏è Exception Handling:
Sportify has a centralized custom exception handling structure that provides clear and meaningful error messages. This ensures:

Consistent response format for all exceptions.
Better debugging through standardized error codes.
Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-21T12:34:56",
  "message": "Player not found",
  "details": "uri=/players/123"
}
üìã Logging:
Implemented AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) for centralized logging of method calls, helping trace application flow and debug issues. This ensures:

Automatic logging of all critical operations (like player creation or competition management).
Clean and maintainable code by separating logging logic from business logic.
Example:
java
Copy code
@Around("execution(* com.sportify.service.*.*(..))")
public Object logAround(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    // Log method entry
    logger.info("Entering method: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    
    // Proceed with the method execution
    Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
    
    // Log method exit
    logger.info("Exiting method: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    return result;
}
üöÄ AWS Deployment:
You can deploy Sportify on AWS EC2 for cloud scalability. Follow these steps:

Package the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn package
Deploy on AWS EC2:

Launch an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu/AMI).
Install Java and Docker on the EC2 instance.
Transfer the JAR file to the instance.
Run the application inside the instance using Docker or java -jar command.
Configure AWS S3 (if needed for file storage):

Use AWS S3 for storing large files such as player images, competition data, etc.
CI/CD with AWS: Integrate with AWS CodeDeploy or Elastic Beanstalk for continuous deployment.
