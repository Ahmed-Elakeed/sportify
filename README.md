🌟 **Excited to Share My Latest Project: Sportify!** 🎉

I am thrilled to announce the completion of **Sportify**, a comprehensive platform designed to streamline competition management and enhance user experiences in the sports domain. This project incorporates a range of features tailored to players, organizers, and competition management.

🔍 **Key Features:**

This project utilizes a robust technology stack, including:

- **JPA** and **Hibernate** for database interactions
- **MySQL** as the database
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS** for cloud services
- **Swagger** for API documentation

Additionally, I've implemented an **AOP logging system**, a **global exception handler** with custom exceptions, and **event listeners** to enhance functionality and maintainability.

📝 **Future Improvements:**
