# Sportify üèÜ
**Sportify** is a comprehensive sports management backend solution, designed to streamline the management of sports teams, players, and competitions. This system is built using **Java Spring Boot**, incorporating modern backend technologies like **JWT-based authentication**, **AOP logging**, **custom exception handling**, and **RESTful APIs**. It‚Äôs a highly scalable solution ready for deployment on **AWS**, with detailed API documentation via **Swagger**.

üîç **Key Features:**
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration with JWT-based authentication.
- Competition Management: Organizers can create, manage, and monitor competitions effortlessly.
- Player Management: Add, update, and remove players from competitions with role-based permissions.
- Performance Tracking: Players can submit scores and track their performance over time.
- User Profiles: Customizable profiles with personal information and profile pictures.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for other players and competitions based on various criteria.

This project utilizes a robust technology stack, including:
- **Java** and **Spring Boot** for the backend
- **JPA** and **Hibernate** for database interactions
- **MySQL** as the database
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS** for cloud services
- **Swagger** for API documentation
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

Additionally, I've implemented an **AOP logging system**, a **global exception handler** with custom exceptions, and **event listeners** to enhance functionality and maintainability.
