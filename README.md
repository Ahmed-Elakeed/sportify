# Sportify üèÜ
**Sportify** is a comprehensive sports management backend solution, designed to streamline the management of sports teams, players, and competitions. This system is built using **Java Spring Boot**, incorporating modern backend technologies like **JWT-based authentication**, **AOP logging**, **custom exception handling**, and **RESTful APIs**. It‚Äôs a highly scalable solution ready for deployment on **AWS**, with detailed API documentation via **Swagger**.

üîç **Key Features:**
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration with JWT-based authentication.
- Competition Management: Organizers can create, manage, and monitor competitions effortlessly.
- Player Management: Add, update, and remove players from competitions with role-based permissions.
- Performance Tracking: Players can submit scores and track their performance over time.
- User Profiles: Customizable profiles with personal information and profile pictures.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for other players and competitions based on various criteria.

This project utilizes a robust technology stack, including:
- **Java** and **Spring Boot** for the backend
- **JPA** and **Hibernate** for database interactions
- **MySQL** as the database
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS** for cloud services
- **Swagger** for API documentation
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

Additionally, I've implemented an **AOP logging system**, a **global exception handler** with custom exceptions, and **event listeners** to enhance functionality and maintainability.

This project employs a **Layered Architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns. The architecture consists of distinct layers: the Controller layer handles HTTP requests and serves as the entry point; the Service layer contains business logic and coordinates data processing; and the Repository layer manages data persistence using Spring Data JPA. Core domain models reside in the Domain layer, while DTOs facilitate data transfer between layers. Supporting packages include Mapper for data transformation, Validation for enforcing business rules, Security for authentication and authorization, Exception for error handling, Util for reusable utilities, and AOP for Aspect-Oriented Programming to provide logging and cross-cutting concerns. This design ensures clean, maintainable, and secure code that adheres to industry best practices.

**Run and Deployment Instructions**
**--Running Locally--**
1- Clone the Repository
Clone this project to your local machine using the following command:
git clone <repository-url>
Then, navigate into the project directory:
cd <repository-name>

2- Set Up the Database
  - Create a database with the same name as specified in the application.properties file.
  - Configure the database connection settings (username, password, and URL) in the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory.
    
3- Build and Run the Project
  - Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.
  - Build the project using the command:
    mvn clean install
  - Run the project:
    mvn spring-boot:run
    The application will start on http://localhost:8080.


**Cloud Deployment**
1- Set Up AWS Resources
  - Create the following AWS resources as specified in the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline file:
    - Amazon RDS: Create a database instance with the name and settings defined in the application.properties file or CI/CD configuration.
    - Amazon ECR: Create a container registry for the application image.
    - Amazon ECS Fargate: Set up a cluster and task definition to run the application.

2- Choose the AWS Profile Locally
  - Ensure you have AWS CLI configured with an appropriate profile for deploying the application. Set the profile in the application code.
    
3- Push Code to Repository
  - After making changes locally and committing them, push the code to the repository:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push
    
4- Automatic CI/CD Deployment
  - The CI/CD pipeline configured in GitHub Actions will automatically:
    - Build the project.
    - Run tests.
    - Build and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR.
    - Deploy the application to AWS ECS Fargate.
    - Update the RDS connection as per the configurations provided.

5- Monitor Deployment
  - You can monitor the deployment logs and pipeline status in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository.


üìù **Future Improvements:**
- Implementing real-time notifications for competition updates.
- Integrating a chat feature for player interaction.
- Adding analytics for performance insights.
